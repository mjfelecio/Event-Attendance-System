/**
 * StatusBadge
 *
 * The app's standard pill for statuses, counts, and short metadata labels
 * ("Total: 128", "APPROVED", "Search Active").
 *
 * ## Prefer this over
 * - Hand-writing `rounded-full border bg-x-50 text-x-700` chips inline.
 * - shad-cn's `Badge`, which is styled from the neutral shadcn token scale and
 *   does not match the soft-fill treatment used across this app.
 *
 * ## Constraints
 * - Keep the label short — this is a chip, not a sentence. Long text breaks the
 *   toolbar rows it usually lives in.
 * - Choose `tone` by meaning. Don't use `success` because green looks nice; use
 *   it because the thing being described actually succeeded.
 * - For an `Event.status`, resolve the tone through {@link EVENT_STATUS_TONE}
 *   rather than hardcoding one, so all four statuses stay consistent app-wide.
 *
 * @example Counter chips in a table toolbar
 * ```tsx
 * <StatusBadge>Total: {total}</StatusBadge>
 * <StatusBadge tone="primary">Visible: {visible}</StatusBadge>
 * ```
 *
 * @example Event status
 * ```tsx
 * <StatusBadge tone={EVENT_STATUS_TONE[event.status]} withDot>
 *   {event.status}
 * </StatusBadge>
 * ```
