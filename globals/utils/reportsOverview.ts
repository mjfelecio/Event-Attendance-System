/**
 * Cross-event attendance aggregation for the reports hub.
 *
 * ## Why this only covers APPROVED events
 *
 * Attendance is only writable on APPROVED events (`domain-model.md` rule 3), so a
 * DRAFT or PENDING event has no records by construction. Including one would
 * report it as 0% turnout for an event that never ran and drag every average down.
 *
 * This also makes authorization trivially safe: an approved event is readable by
 * every active user (`assertEventVisibility` — "approval makes an event shared"),
 * so restricting to APPROVED is *strictly narrower* than what any caller may see.
 * There is no way for this to leak another organizer's draft.
 *
 * @see docs/plans/reports-overhaul.md

 * A stable key for "these events share an eligibility filter".

 * on their sorted slugs. Events that share a key share both their eligible count
 * and one batched record query, which is what keeps this from being 2N round trips.
