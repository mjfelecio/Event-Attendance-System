/**
 * Canonical design tokens for the Event Attendance System.
 *
 * These strings are the *literal* Tailwind class lists used by the Student List
 * pages, which `docs/design-system.md` designates as the visual source of truth.
 * They are exported here so new UI can import the real pattern instead of
 * re-deriving it (and drifting) from memory.
 *
 * ## When to use these
 *
 * Import a token when you are building a **page shell, panel, card, eyebrow, or
 * pill action** — the structural pieces that make screens look like they belong
 * to this app. For everything else, prefer an actual component
 * (`Button`, `FormInput`, `DataTable`, `StatusBadge`) over a token string.
 *
 * ## When NOT to use these
 *
 * Don't reach for a token to style a one-off element that a shad-cn primitive
 * already covers. Tokens exist to stop *structural* drift, not to replace the
 * component layer. If you find yourself composing three tokens to fake a
 * component that already exists, use the component.
 *
 * @see docs/design-system.md — the written playbook
 * @see /design-system — the interactive reference page
