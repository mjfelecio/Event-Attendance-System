/**
 * Seed data and tile presentation for the school's group vocabulary.
 *
 * **The `Group` table is the source of truth, not this file.** Every write path
 * and every picker reads the database: `validateStudentGroupSlugs` resolves
 * student slugs against it, `validateEventGroupIds` resolves event group ids,
 * and the student form, event drawer, and students selection boards all
 * render options fetched from `/api/groups`. Groups are created and deleted by
 * admins in Settings, so a group can perfectly well exist without appearing
 * here.
 *
 * What this file is still for:
 * - the vocabulary `prisma/seed.ts` inserts into a fresh database, and
 * - the per-slug artwork and grouping the `Group` table has no column for
 *   (department logos and abbreviations, house logos, a strand's track),
 *   consumed through `features/students/constants/categories.ts`.
 *
 * Adding an entry here does **not** create a group. It only gives an existing
 * group nicer presentation the next time the boards render it.
