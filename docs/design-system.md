# Design System

**Canonical reference for how UI in the Event Attendance System should look.**

The interactive version lives at [`/design-system`](../app/(main)/design-system/page.tsx)
— run the app and open it. That page *shows* the components; this document explains
the reasoning and the rules. Component API detail lives in JSDoc on the components
themselves.

## Where this came from

The app was built over a long period, partly with AI assistance, and accumulated
several parallel visual languages. This system does not invent a new one. It
documents the best of what already exists.

**The Manage List pages are the source of truth.** They are the most deliberate,
internally consistent screens in the app, and everything below was extracted from
them:

- `app/(main)/manage-list/page.tsx` — overview/landing
- `app/(main)/manage-list/manage-which/page.tsx` — selection sub-page
- `app/(main)/manage-list/manage-student/page.tsx` — data-heavy roster
- `features/manage-list/components/**` — the components those pages compose

The Dashboard independently adopted much of the same language, which is good
corroboration. Attendance, Reports, and Calendar diverge — see
[Known deviations](#known-deviations).

## Foundations

### Colour

**Primary is Tailwind `indigo-600`.** Use the stock Tailwind indigo scale. Never
introduce a bespoke primary hex.

| Step | Used for |
|---|---|
| `indigo-50` | Chip fills, subtle washes |
| `indigo-100` | Eyebrow text on the dark hero |
| `indigo-200` | Chip borders, hover borders |
| `indigo-400` | Focus rings (`ring-indigo-400/60`) |
| `indigo-500` | Primary hover, accent dots |
| **`indigo-600`** | **Primary — actions, eyebrows, active nav** |
| `indigo-700` | Chip text, emphasis numerals |

The shadcn `--primary` CSS variable resolves to indigo-600, so `<Button>`,
`<Checkbox>`, and `<Switch>` inherit it. This was changed as part of establishing
this system — it was previously stock shadcn neutral (near-black), which meant the
primitive layer visually contradicted every hand-styled action in Manage List.

**Neutrals are slate.** `slate-900` headings, `slate-600` body, `slate-500`
supporting copy, `slate-200` borders, `slate-50` inset surfaces.

**Semantic tones.** Six tones cover every status in the app. Pick by *meaning*,
never by preferred hue.

| Tone | Meaning | Event status |
|---|---|---|
| `neutral` | Counts, inert metadata | — |
| `primary` | The app's own emphasis | — |
| `info` | In progress | `PENDING` |
| `success` | Done, present | `APPROVED` |
| `warning` | Needs attention | `DRAFT` |
| `danger` | Failure, absent | `REJECTED` |

Resolve an `Event.status` through `EVENT_STATUS_TONE` in
`globals/components/shared/StatusBadge.tsx` rather than hardcoding a colour.

### Typography

Poppins (`--font-sans`) throughout. The **eyebrow + title** pair is the app's
signature header treatment:

```
eyebrow    text-xs font-semibold uppercase tracking-[0.2em] text-indigo-600
title      text-3xl font-semibold tracking-tight md:text-4xl
subtitle   text-sm text-slate-500
```

Use `PageHeader` rather than reproducing this by hand.

### Surfaces

Three levels, and radii step *down* with nesting:

| Token | Radius | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `page.surface` | — | Full-page background (radial indigo→white wash) |
| `surface.panel` | `rounded-3xl` | The container holding a page's main content |
| `surface.card` | `rounded-2xl` | A content unit inside a panel |
| `surface.cardInteractive` | `rounded-2xl` | A card that is itself a link — adds lift + indigo hover |

Panels may layer `surface.panelGlow` (an absolutely-positioned indigo radial wash)
behind a `relative` content wrapper.

### Spacing & focus

Page padding `p-6 md:p-8`. Stack gap `gap-6`. Container `max-w-6xl`
(`max-w-7xl` for data-heavy screens).

Every custom interactive element needs a visible focus ring — use the shared
`focusRing` token. shad-cn primitives carry their own.

All of the above are exported from
[`globals/constants/designTokens.ts`](../globals/constants/designTokens.ts).
Import them instead of re-deriving the class strings from memory.

## Components

Live examples: [`/design-system`](../app/(main)/design-system/page.tsx) →
**Components**.

| Need | Use | Not |
|---|---|---|
| Ordinary action | `Button` (shad-cn) | A hand-styled `<button>` |
| Toolbar action | `pill.primary` / `pill.secondary` tokens | `Button` mixed into a pill row |
| Text field | `FormInput` | Bare `Input` + hand-written label |
| Select | `FormSelect` (needs `control`) | Raw `Select` in a `Controller` |
| Searchable select | `ComboBox` | `FormSelect` with 50 options |
| Multi-select | `CheckboxGroup` | Several checkboxes in a row |
| Status / count chip | `StatusBadge` | Inline `rounded-full bg-x-50` |
| Page title | `PageHeader` | A bare `<h1>` |
| Table | `DataTable` (shared) | `StudentsDataTable` (Manage List only) |
| Confirmation | `useConfirm()` | A bespoke dialog |
| Form panel | `Sheet` | `Drawer` (legacy) |
| Transient feedback | `toastSuccess` / `Warning` / `Danger` | `alert()` |
| Persistent message | `Alert` | A toast |
| Table loading/empty/error | `DataTableStates` exports | Per-feature placeholders |

Two rules worth stating explicitly:

- **`useConfirm()` is mandatory for every irreversible action.** This is the one
  convention in the codebase with zero exceptions. Breaking it is the easiest way
  to cause accidental attendance-data loss.
- **`toastWarning` ≠ `toastDanger`.** Warning is for a no-op that isn't a failure
  ("attendance was already recorded"). During an event, red for a harmless
  duplicate scan makes an organizer think data was lost and start re-scanning.

## Page patterns

### Overview / landing
Hero `PageHeader`, then a panel of `cardInteractive` tiles that navigate deeper.
*Reference: Manage List landing, Dashboard.*

### List / management
Toolbar panel (title + counter chips + actions + search) directly above a table.
The workhorse pattern. *Reference: `manage-student`.*

### Selection / sub-page
Back link, plain `PageHeader`, then a `SelectionBoardFrame` panel of choice cards.
*Reference: `manage-which`.*

### Form
Forms live in a `Sheet`, not on their own route. Multi-step forms use a step
indicator, validate per step with `methods.trigger([...])`, and pin Back/Next in
the footer. *Reference: `StudentFormDrawer`.*

### Dashboard / metrics
A row of metric cards above grouped sections. Metric value takes the tone colour;
the icon tile carries a matching gradient. *Reference: Dashboard.*

### Attendance (live operator screen)
The one screen operated under time pressure by someone who didn't build the app.
Optimise for legibility and unambiguous feedback over density: large scan target,
a toast on **every** scan, live table below, and a visible event-mode indicator so
the operator always knows whether they're recording time-in or time-out.

## Responsive guidance

**The app is not currently fully responsive, and this system does not fix that.**
A separate effort will. These rules exist so new work doesn't deepen the problem.

**Breakpoints in use:** `sm` 640 · `md` 768 · `lg` 1024 · `xl` 1280. Padding steps
at `md`, titles step at `md`, toolbars collapse at `lg`/`xl`.

**Principles:**

1. **Mobile-first classes.** Write the narrow layout, then add `md:`/`lg:`
   overrides. Don't start at desktop and bolt on overrides.
2. **The page body must never scroll horizontally.** Wide content — tables,
   toolbars, chip rows — scrolls inside its own `overflow-x-auto` container.
3. **Stack, don't shrink.** Toolbar rows are `flex-col` by default, `flex-row` at
   `lg`/`xl`. Shrinking a control below its tap target is worse than stacking.
4. **Tap targets ≥ 40px** in any flow an organizer uses during an event.
5. **Test at 375px.** If the page scrolls sideways there, it's wrong.

**Known to need responsive work** (not in scope here):

- Manage List toolbar — pills wrap, but search competes for room below `md`
- `StudentsDataTable` — no horizontal scroll container; wide rosters overflow
- Attendance page — the primary mobile surface, built at desktop width
- Calendar — FullCalendar's month grid is unusable below `sm`
- Dashboard metric row — four across doesn't collapse cleanly on small tablets

## Known deviations

Recorded, not fixed. Establishing the target state is the point; a broad refactor
is deliberately out of scope. **Follow the "preferred" column in new work.**

| Deviation | Where | Preferred |
|---|---|---|
| Two table implementations | `StudentsDataTable` vs shared `DataTable` | Shared `DataTable` |
| Three page shells | Manage List/Dashboard use `page.surface`; Attendance `bg-white p-6`; Reports `p-4` | `page.surface` |
| Event-status colours duplicated | Dashboard `chipClass`, calendar `EventCard` | `EVENT_STATUS_TONE` |
| `Sheet` and `Drawer` coexist | `StudentFormDrawer` vs `EventDrawer` | `Sheet` |
| Manage List `Pagination` duplicates the shared one | `StudentsDataTable/Pagination.tsx` | Shared `DataTablePagination` |
| Dark mode is dead code | `globals.css` `.dark` block and a `prefers-color-scheme` rule that sets inverted values; nothing activates either | Don't write `dark:` variants |

Each has a tracked backlog issue under the `ui` label.

## Rules for AI agents

If you are asked to *"create a new screen for X"*, these are binding.

1. **Consult this document and `/design-system` before creating any new UI.**
2. **Prefer an existing reusable component** over writing a new one. Check the
   component table above first.
3. **Follow the established page-level patterns** rather than inventing a layout.
4. **Use the documented tokens** for colour, spacing, typography, and interaction.
   Import from `globals/constants/designTokens.ts`.
5. **Don't introduce arbitrary new visual styles** because they're convenient.
6. **Don't add a new component** when an existing one satisfies the requirement.
7. **If a genuinely new pattern is required**, say so explicitly and propose it as
   an addition to this system rather than quietly inventing it.
8. **Treat the Manage List pages and `/design-system` as canonical.** When this
   document and the code disagree, the Manage List pages win, and this document
   should be corrected.
9. **Preserve the existing architecture** unless there's a concrete benefit to
   changing it.
10. **Prefer incremental improvements over rewrites.** Do not "bring a page in
    line with the design system" as an unrequested side effect of another task —
    file an issue instead.

### Two specific traps

- **Never build Tailwind class names at runtime.** `` `bg-${color}-500` `` produces
  unstyled elements because Tailwind only ships classes it can find as complete
  literals. This has already caused a real bug (past calendar events rendering as
  blank bars). Use a static lookup map.
- **Don't reach for a token to fake a component that already exists.** Tokens
  prevent *structural* drift; they're not a substitute for the component layer.
