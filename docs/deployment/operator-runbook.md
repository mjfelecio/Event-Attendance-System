# Operator Runbook

**For whoever is on-site during the event.** Every procedure here is a fallback
for when the app itself can't be reached — a broken build, a page that won't
load, a login nobody can get past. Each section names the in-app screen that
normally does the job, so try that first.

You need a terminal in the project folder for everything below. Prisma Studio is
a database editor in a browser tab:

```bash
pnpm db:studio        # opens http://localhost:5555
```

> **Never run `pnpm db:seed` on the event database.** The seed deletes every
> record, event, student, group, and user before inserting demo data. It is
> guarded against `NODE_ENV=production`, but that guard is the only thing
> standing between a mistyped command and losing the week's attendance.

## 1. Back up the database

**Do this before anything else in this document, and every few hours during the
event.** Everything is in one SQLite file.

```bash
# With the server stopped, or at a quiet moment:
cp prisma/dev.db "backups/dev-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M).db"
```

To restore: stop the server, copy a backup back over `prisma/dev.db`, restart.

There is no in-app equivalent. This one is always manual.

---

## 2. Add a missing section, department, house, program, or strand

**Normally: Settings → Groups → Add group.**

This is the failure that stops a roster import dead. The importer rejects the
*entire* file if one value is unknown:

```
Unknown group(s): BSIT-3A. Fix and retry.
```

### In the app (preferred)

1. Sign in as an admin → **Settings** → **Groups** → **Add group**.
2. Name it (`BSIT-3A`), check the slug (`bsit-3a`), pick the category
   (`SECTION`).
3. Re-run the import. No restart, no waiting.

### Via Prisma Studio (fallback)

1. `pnpm db:studio` → **Group** → **Add record**.
2. Fill in three fields; leave `id`, `createdAt`, and `updatedAt` alone:

   | Field | What to put |
   |---|---|
   | `name` | What people call it — `BSIT-3A`, `Computer Studies` |
   | `slug` | **Exactly what the CSV column contains.** Lowercase, numbers, hyphens: `bsit-3a` |
   | `category` | One of `SECTION`, `DEPARTMENT`, `HOUSE`, `PROGRAM`, `STRAND`, `YEAR` |

3. Save, then re-run the import.

**The slug is the part that matters.** The importer matches a student's CSV value
against `Group.slug`, not against the name. Two live examples of why they differ:

- Strands are slugified from their *code*: the "Computer System Servicing" strand
  has the slug `css`.
- Seeded programs are lowercase: `BSIT` is stored as `bsit`.

`category` must also match the column. A house slug in the section column is
rejected with a "Group category mismatch" error.

### Before onboarding day

Only four sections are seeded (`BSCS-2A`, `BSIT-2B`, `STEM-11A`, `STEM-12B`) and
only four of the thirteen programs. **Reconcile the real school's sections,
departments, programs, strands, and houses against Settings → Groups before
anyone imports a real roster**, and add what's missing. It takes minutes up
front and prevents the import failure entirely.

## 3. Reset a forgotten password

**Normally: Settings → Users → Reset password.** The admin is shown a temporary
password to read out; the user is forced to choose their own at next sign-in.

### Via Prisma Studio (fallback — no admin can sign in)

1. `pnpm db:studio` → **User** → find the row by email.
2. Type a plain password straight into the `password` field — for example
   `TempPass123` — and save.
3. Tell them to sign in with it.

This works because the login route accepts a plaintext value and silently
replaces it with a proper hash on the first successful sign-in. It is
self-healing; you do not need to hash anything yourself.

Optionally also set `mustChangePassword` to `true`, which forces them to pick
their own password before they reach the app.

---

## 4. Unblock a user who can't sign in

Check the `User` row's `status` in Prisma Studio.

| Message they see | `status` | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| "Account pending admin approval." | `PENDING` | An admin approves them on the **Dashboard**. Fallback: set `status` to `ACTIVE`. |
| "Your registration was rejected…" | `REJECTED` | Set `status` to `ACTIVE` and clear `rejectionReason`. |
| "Too many login attempts." | — | Wait five minutes, or restart the server — the limit is in memory. |
| "Invalid credentials." | — | Reset their password (§3). |

To make someone an admin, set `role` to `ADMIN`. Permission changes take effect
on their next request; they may need to reload the page.

**There is no in-app screen for any of this yet** — Settings → Users is a
directory plus password reset, and the Dashboard only reviews *pending*
organizers. Once a user is ACTIVE, this runbook is the only route.

---

## 5. A whole 2,000-row import fails

- **"Unknown group(s): …"** — a missing group. See §2.
- **"Group category mismatch"** — a value is in the wrong column (a house name
  in the section column). Fix the CSV.
- **"Database error occurred." on a very large file** — split it into batches of
  200–300 rows. **Retrying is safe**: imports upsert, so a re-run never creates
  duplicates.

---

## 6. Nothing loads at all / "Database error occurred." on every page

Most often `AUTH_SECRET` is unset in a production build. The error message says
"database", but the cause is configuration.

1. Check `Settings → System` if you can still reach it — it reports whether
   `AUTH_SECRET` is set and long enough, and which database file is in use.
2. Otherwise, in `.env`:

   ```
   AUTH_SECRET="a-long-random-string-at-least-16-characters"
   ```

3. Restart the server. Everyone must sign in again — changing the secret
   invalidates every existing session cookie.

---

## 7. Check the server clock

**Settings → System** shows the server's current time. Compare it against a
phone before the event. A wrong host clock silently writes wrong attendance
timestamps, and there is no way to tell after the fact.
